Hi Claude, this is a project I cloned from a friend, see README.md first

New requirements: [x] Rename it to "Second Opinion MCP" [x] remove
deepseek-reasoner altogether [x] tell me where is the list of allowable models,
we will need to shorten it [ ] tell me how to edit the model prompt, we will
simplify and shorten it [ ] We will shorten README.md drastically, and move rest
of the content to "DETAILS.md"
